In computer architecture, a word is a unit of measurement for a processor that is the size of an integer register on the processor. For modern processors words are usually 4 bytes or 8 bytes long.

In programming, a word might have a different meaning for compatibility reasons. For example, in the Windows API, the type `WORD` explicitly means a 2-byte value, regardless of [[architecture]].
