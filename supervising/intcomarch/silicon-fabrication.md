Silicon fabrication is the process of fabricating chips that make use of semiconductors.

There are different technology 'nodes' that historically represent the size of the transistors fabricated on the chip, for example 350nm, 250nm, etc. In the modern day, the newest technology nodes like 7nm and 5nm have no relation to the size of the transistor fabricated.

The [[yield]] of a fabrication process corresponds to the percentage of the unit area that has defects, due to anomalies like dust, impurities, too much/too little doping. By manufacturing smaller chips, the percentage of chips without defects will increase.

Manufacturing a chip has a very high one-off cost for producing the mask, and producing subsequent chips is very cheap. This means that chips produced have to have a large target market, or else the losses from the one-off mask production cost will not be recovered.
