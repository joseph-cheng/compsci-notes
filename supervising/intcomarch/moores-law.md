Moore's Law is an empirical observation that transistor density on a chip roughly doubles every 18 months:

People have been saying that Moore's Law is dead for many years, but it does not appear to have stopped just yet.

Having smaller transistors helps in many ways. When combined with [[dennard-scaling|Dennard scaling]], we get free [[clock-frequency|clock frequency]] increases. For the same area, we can also create a chip with more transistors, which allows us to e.g. add more cores to a [[multiple-core]] processor, or increase the complexity of features like [[branch-prediction|branch predictors]], or increase [[caches|cache]] size.

By [[silicon-fabrication|fabricating]] smaller chips, we also increase overall chip yield, since even if the [[yield]] of our fabrication process remains the same, we reduce the percentage of chips that have defects.
