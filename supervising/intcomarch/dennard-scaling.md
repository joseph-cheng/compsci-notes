Dennard scaling was a property first noticed in 1974, which is given by the following derivation:

 - As [[moores-law|Moore's law]] noticed, area is usually halved every technology node.
 - As such, delay reduces by around 30% and thus [[clock-frequency|clock frequency]] can increase by about 40%
 - To keep electric field constant, voltage is reduced by 30%, and at 1.4x clock frequency the power consumption of the chip is reduced by 50%

So, for the same area, transistor density doubles, speed increases by 40%, and power consumption remains the same, which means that just by improving the technology node, we can get a 40% free speed-up along with the extra transistors.

However, in 2006, this broke down once the transistors became so small that their [[transistor-power-consumption|power leakage]] became dominant.

This meant that we could no longer increase the clock frequency and keep power consumption constant, so we must instead rely on performance increases from utilising the extra transistors.
