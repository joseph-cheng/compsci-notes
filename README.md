# General Notes

This repository contains a set of notes for a variety of computer science topics. Currently only for computer architecture (in particular the [Introduction to Computer Architecture](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/2223/IntComArch/) at the University of Cambridge), but later intended for C/C++, Hoare Logic, and Model Checking.

The notes are intended to be viewed with Obsidian.
